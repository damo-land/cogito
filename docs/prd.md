# WYSIWYG Markdown Editor Chrome Extension Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable instant markdown-to-rich-text conversion directly in Chrome new tabs, similar to Notion's editing experience
- Provide local data storage to ensure privacy and security for personal information 
- Create an always-accessible note-taking solution that appears automatically on every new tab
- Deliver immediate visual feedback for markdown syntax without exposing raw markdown to users
- Eliminate friction in capturing thoughts and notes by making formatted writing immediately available

### Background Context
The modern web lacks a truly integrated, privacy-first note-taking solution that combines the visual appeal of WYSIWYG editing with the portability and simplicity of markdown. While tools like Notion excel at rich editing experiences, they require separate applications and cloud storage, creating barriers to quick note capture. This extension transforms every new browser window into an instant writing environment that immediately renders markdown syntax into formatted text without ever showing raw markdown to users.

Current solutions either sacrifice editing experience for simplicity (plain text editors) or privacy for features (cloud-based tools). This extension addresses both concerns by delivering Notion-quality editing with complete local storage and immediate markdown rendering, making it ideal for personal information, sensitive notes, and rapid idea capture without requiring markdown knowledge.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create a clean, distraction-free writing environment that feels as natural as Notion but launches instantly in every new Chrome tab. The interface should disappear into the background, letting users focus entirely on their content while providing powerful editing capabilities through intuitive interactions.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Slash commands** (/) for quick block insertion (headings, lists, code blocks)
- **Hover toolbars** that appear on text selection for formatting options
- **Immediate rendering** where markdown syntax instantly becomes formatted text without preview modes
- **Keyboard-first navigation** with mouse interactions as enhancement
- **Contextual menus** that adapt based on cursor position and content type

### Core Screens and Views
- **Main Editor View** - Full-screen WYSIWYG markdown editor with minimal chrome
- **Document Sidebar** - Collapsible file navigator showing all saved documents
- **Search Overlay** - Modal search interface with live results and document previews
- **Settings Panel** - Configuration options for editor preferences and export settings
- **Import/Export Dialog** - File management interface for document operations

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The extension will meet WCAG AA standards including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, sufficient color contrast, and focus management for all interactive elements.

### Branding
Clean, minimalist aesthetic inspired by modern writing tools like Notion, Linear, and Obsidian. Dark and light theme support with system preference detection. Typography-focused design emphasizing readability and content hierarchy.

### Target Device and Platforms: Desktop Only
Chrome desktop browser (Windows, macOS, Linux) with minimum screen width of 1024px. Optimized for desktop writing workflows with full keyboard support.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing the Chrome extension with clear separation between content scripts, background scripts, and UI components.

### Service Architecture
Chrome extension architecture with:
- **Background script** for extension lifecycle and tab management
- **Content script** for new tab override and editor initialization  
- **Popup/options pages** for settings and configuration
- **Local storage layer** using IndexedDB for document persistence

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit testing** for core editor logic and markdown parsing
- **Integration testing** for Chrome extension APIs and storage operations
- **Manual testing** procedures for user interface flows and cross-browser compatibility
- **Performance testing** for large document handling and memory usage

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Use modern JavaScript (ES2022+) with TypeScript for type safety
- Implement a robust markdown parser (likely Unified.js/Remark ecosystem)
- Utilize a proven rich text editor foundation (ProseMirror or similar)
- Ensure compatibility with Chrome Manifest V3 requirements
- Implement proper error handling and data backup mechanisms
- Design for future extensibility (plugins, themes, sync capabilities)
