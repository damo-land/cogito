# Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing the Chrome extension with clear separation between content scripts, background scripts, and UI components.

### Service Architecture
Chrome extension architecture with:
- **Background script** for extension lifecycle and tab management
- **Content script** for new tab override and editor initialization  
- **Popup/options pages** for settings and configuration
- **Local storage layer** using IndexedDB for document persistence

### Testing Requirements
- **Unit testing** for core editor logic and markdown parsing
- **Integration testing** for Chrome extension APIs and storage operations
- **Manual testing** procedures for user interface flows and cross-browser compatibility
- **Performance testing** for large document handling and memory usage

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- Use modern JavaScript (ES2022+) with TypeScript for type safety
- Implement a robust markdown parser (likely Unified.js/Remark ecosystem)
- Utilize a proven rich text editor foundation (ProseMirror or similar)
- Ensure compatibility with Chrome Manifest V3 requirements
- Implement proper error handling and data backup mechanisms
- Design for future extensibility (plugins, themes, sync capabilities)
