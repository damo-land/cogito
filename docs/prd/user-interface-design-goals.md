# User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
Create a clean, distraction-free writing environment that feels as natural as Notion but launches instantly in every new Chrome tab. The interface should disappear into the background, letting users focus entirely on their content while providing powerful editing capabilities through intuitive interactions.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Slash commands** (/) for quick block insertion (headings, lists, code blocks)
- **Hover toolbars** that appear on text selection for formatting options
- **Immediate rendering** where markdown syntax instantly becomes formatted text without preview modes
- **Keyboard-first navigation** with mouse interactions as enhancement
- **Contextual menus** that adapt based on cursor position and content type

### Core Screens and Views
- **Main Editor View** - Full-screen WYSIWYG markdown editor with minimal chrome
- **Document Sidebar** - Collapsible file navigator showing all saved documents
- **Search Overlay** - Modal search interface with live results and document previews
- **Settings Panel** - Configuration options for editor preferences and export settings
- **Import/Export Dialog** - File management interface for document operations

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
The extension will meet WCAG AA standards including keyboard navigation, screen reader support, sufficient color contrast, and focus management for all interactive elements.

### Branding
Clean, minimalist aesthetic inspired by modern writing tools like Notion, Linear, and Obsidian. Dark and light theme support with system preference detection. Typography-focused design emphasizing readability and content hierarchy.

### Target Device and Platforms: Desktop Only
Chrome desktop browser (Windows, macOS, Linux) with minimum screen width of 1024px. Optimized for desktop writing workflows with full keyboard support.
