# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Extension Infrastructure
Establish the fundamental Chrome extension architecture and override new tab functionality while delivering a basic but functional markdown editor that demonstrates the core value proposition.

## Story 1.1: Chrome Extension Foundation Setup
As a developer,
I want to create the basic Chrome extension structure with proper manifest,
so that the extension can be loaded and installed in Chrome.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Extension manifest v3 is properly configured with required permissions
2. Extension can be loaded in Chrome developer mode without errors
3. Basic folder structure follows Chrome extension best practices
4. Extension appears in Chrome extension management interface
5. All required permissions are properly declared (tabs, storage, activeTab)

## Story 1.2: New Tab Override Implementation
As a user,
I want the extension to replace Chrome's default new tab page,
so that I immediately see the markdown editor when opening new tabs.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Opening a new tab displays the extension interface instead of Chrome's default page
2. The override works consistently across all new tab triggers (Ctrl+T, clicking +, etc.)
3. Extension gracefully handles cases where it might conflict with other new tab extensions
4. Page loads within 500ms of tab creation
5. Browser back/forward functionality works appropriately with the overridden page

## Story 1.3: Basic Local Storage Implementation
As a user,
I want my content to be automatically saved locally,
so that my notes persist between browser sessions.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Content is automatically saved to browser local storage as user types
2. Saved content is restored when opening new tabs or restarting browser
3. Storage uses IndexedDB for robust data persistence
4. Storage operations do not block the UI or cause performance issues
5. Basic error handling exists for storage failures

## Story 1.4: Simple Markdown Editor Interface
As a user,
I want a clean, functional text editor interface,
so that I can start writing markdown content immediately.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Text area immediately converts markdown syntax to formatted text as user types
2. Basic toolbar provides common formatting buttons (bold, italic, headers)
3. Editor renders all text as formatted output with no raw markdown visible
4. Interface is responsive and works on desktop screen sizes (1024px+)
5. Basic styling creates a pleasant, distraction-free writing environment
