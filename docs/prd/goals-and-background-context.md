# Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable instant markdown-to-rich-text conversion directly in Chrome new tabs, similar to Notion's editing experience
- Provide local data storage to ensure privacy and security for personal information 
- Create an always-accessible note-taking solution that appears automatically on every new tab
- Deliver immediate visual feedback for markdown syntax without exposing raw markdown to users
- Eliminate friction in capturing thoughts and notes by making formatted writing immediately available

### Background Context
The modern web lacks a truly integrated, privacy-first note-taking solution that combines the visual appeal of WYSIWYG editing with the portability and simplicity of markdown. While tools like Notion excel at rich editing experiences, they require separate applications and cloud storage, creating barriers to quick note capture. This extension transforms every new browser window into an instant writing environment that immediately renders markdown syntax into formatted text without ever showing raw markdown to users.

Current solutions either sacrifice editing experience for simplicity (plain text editors) or privacy for features (cloud-based tools). This extension addresses both concerns by delivering Notion-quality editing with complete local storage and immediate markdown rendering, making it ideal for personal information, sensitive notes, and rapid idea capture without requiring markdown knowledge.
