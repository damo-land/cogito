# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the WYSIWYG Markdown Editor Chrome Extension, including frontend implementation, local storage systems, and Chrome extension integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach addresses the unique challenges of creating a privacy-first, local-only Chrome extension that provides Notion-like editing experience with immediate markdown rendering, optimized for performance and user privacy.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision:** Greenfield project with carefully selected proven libraries for Chrome extension best practices.

**Rationale:** Custom greenfield approach chosen because:
- Unique requirements (new tab override + immediate markdown rendering) are specialized
- Performance constraints require precise control over bundle size and memory usage
- Chrome extension Manifest V3 requirements need specific optimization
- Editor customization requires exact control over markdown parsing and rendering behavior
