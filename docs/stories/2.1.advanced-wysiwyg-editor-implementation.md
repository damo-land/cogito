# Story 2.1: Advanced WYSIWYG Editor Implementation

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to edit markdown with rich text formatting that updates in real-time,
**so that** I can focus on content without thinking about syntax.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Typing markdown syntax immediately creates formatted text without requiring markdown knowledge
2. Markdown syntax (_bold_, # heading) is instantly converted to rich formatting as user types
3. Editor displays only formatted content - no raw markdown view is provided to users
4. Editor handles supported markdown elements (headers, bold, italic, lists, links, simple code blocks)
5. Performance remains smooth during instant conversion and rendering

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

[Source: Story 1.4 Implementation]

Key insights from Story 1.4 completion:

- **ProseMirror Foundation**: SimpleProseMirrorEditor already established with basic schema (headings, paragraphs, bold, italic, code)
- **Markdown Processing**: SimpleMarkdownService implemented with remark/unified.js for parsing and serialization
- **Performance Considerations**: Bundle size currently ~523KB, need to maintain performance with advanced features
- **Architecture Decision**: Simplified schema approach was chosen over complex implementations to ensure TypeScript compatibility
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and graceful error handling already implemented

### Architecture and Tech Stack

[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]

- **Rich Text Editor**: ProseMirror 1.18+ (industry standard for complex editing)
- **Markdown Parser**: Remark/Unified.js 10.0+ (robust parsing ecosystem)
- **Frontend Framework**: React 18.2+ for component architecture
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS 3.3+ for styling system
- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer for editor state

### Editor Component Specifications

[Source: architecture.md#components]

Editor Component responsibilities:

- **Core Function**: ProseMirror-based rich text editor with immediate markdown rendering
- **Key Interfaces**: Document content management, real-time markdown-to-rich-text conversion, keyboard shortcut handling
- **Dependencies**: ProseMirror, Remark parser, Document storage service
- **Technology Stack**: React component wrapping ProseMirror EditorView with custom schema

### Project Structure Alignment

└── src/styles/
    └── editor.css                          # Enhanced styling for new elements
```

### Data Models and Schema Extensions

[Source: architecture.md#data-models]

Document model remains the same but content structure expands:

```typescript
// Enhanced ProseMirror schema to support:
interface AdvancedEditorSchema {
  nodes: {
    doc;
    paragraph;
    text;
    heading; // Existing from 1.4
    bullet_list;
    ordered_list;
    list_item; // NEW
    code_block; // Enhanced from simple code
    // Note: links will be handled as marks, not nodes
  };
  marks: {
    strong;
    em;
    code; // Existing from 1.4
    link; // NEW - with href attribute
  };
}
```

### Performance Requirements

[Source: architecture.md#security-and-performance]

- **Performance Target**: <500ms editor response time for all operations
- **Memory Management**: Clean up ProseMirror instances, event listeners when components unmount
- **Bundle Size**: Maintain <2MB total extension size (current ~523KB base)
- **Typing Performance**: Smooth rendering during instant conversion without lag

### Integration Requirements

**Storage Integration**:

- Must work with existing useEditor hook and auto-save functionality
- Enhanced content structure must serialize/deserialize properly
- Maintain compatibility with existing Document storage format

**Extension Integration**:

- Continue working within Chrome extension new tab context
- Maintain integration with existing NewTab component

### Testing

#### Specific Test Patterns:

[Source: architecture.md#test-examples]

Use Vitest + React Testing Library pattern:

```typescript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from "@testing-library/react";
import { vi } from "vitest";
import { ProseMirrorEditor } from "@/components/editor/ProseMirrorEditor";

// Test pattern for input rule testing
it("should convert markdown syntax to formatted text", async () => {
  // Test typing "**bold**" converts to <strong>bold</strong>
  // Test typing "# heading" converts to <h1>heading</h1>
  // etc.
});
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation successfully delivers all core acceptance criteria with a robust ProseMirror-based architecture. The advanced WYSIWYG editor provides seamless markdown-to-rich-text conversion, comprehensive element support, and maintains good performance characteristics. However, several code quality issues were identified that require attention before production deployment.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: src/components/editor/Toolbar.tsx
  - **Change**: Added null-safety checks and try-catch blocks to all isActive functions
  - **Why**: Prevents runtime errors when editor state is undefined or incomplete during testing
  - **How**: Added `$from?.parent?.type` safe navigation and `typeof $from.node !== 'function'` checks

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ⚠️ ESLint configuration missing, TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Project Structure: ✅ Follows established patterns from previous stories
- Testing Strategy: ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (107 tests) with Vitest + React Testing Library
- All ACs Met: ✅ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist
