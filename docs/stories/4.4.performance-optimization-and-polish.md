**Document Virtualization Approach:**

- Implement virtual scrolling for documents >1MB
- Progressive rendering for large documents
- Lazy loading of editor components and toolbar features
- Smart DOM updates to minimize re-rendering

**ProseMirror Optimization:**

- Custom document slicing for large content
- Optimized schema for performance-critical operations
- Debounced state updates for typing operations
- Efficient undo/redo history management

### Memory Management Specifications

interface MemoryManager {
  trackMemoryUsage(): MemoryInfo;
  cleanupProseMirrorInstances(): void;
  optimizeReactRendering(): void;
  preventMemoryLeaks(): void;
  monitorLargeDocumentImpact(): void;
}

// Target memory usage under 50MB
interface MemoryTargets {
  baseExtension: number; // <20MB
  editor: number; // <15MB
  storage: number; // <10MB
  overhead: number; // <5MB
}
```

### Animation and Transition Optimization
