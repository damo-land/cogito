# Story 1.2: New Tab Override Implementation

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** the extension to replace Chrome's default new tab page,
**so that** I immediately see the markdown editor when opening new tabs.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Opening a new tab displays the extension interface instead of Chrome's default page
2. The override works consistently across all new tab triggers (Ctrl+T, clicking +, etc.)
3. Extension gracefully handles cases where it might conflict with other new tab extensions
4. Page loads within 500ms of tab creation
5. Browser back/forward functionality works appropriately with the overridden page

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Configure new tab override in manifest (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Set chrome_url_overrides.newtab in manifest.json
  - [ ] Point to newtab.html in public directory
  - [ ] Verify manifest configuration is valid
- [ ] Create newtab.html entry point (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Create basic HTML structure with React mount point
  - [ ] Include necessary CSS and JS bundle references
  - [ ] Optimize for fast loading (inline critical CSS)
  - [ ] Add meta tags for viewport and performance
- [ ] Implement React application initialization (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Create src/pages/NewTab.tsx as main component
  - [ ] Set up React root and rendering
  - [ ] Add basic app layout structure
  - [ ] Implement loading states and error boundaries
- [ ] Add conflict detection and graceful handling (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Detect if other new tab extensions are active
  - [ ] Provide user feedback about extension conflicts
  - [ ] Implement fallback behavior for conflicts
- [ ] Optimize performance for 500ms target (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement code splitting for non-critical components
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics
  - [ ] Optimize bundle size and loading strategy
  - [ ] Add preloading for critical resources
- [ ] Test browser navigation integration (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Verify back/forward button behavior
  - [ ] Test history API integration
  - [ ] Ensure proper URL handling
  - [ ] Test session restoration

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context

**Story 1.1 Dependency**: Requires completed Chrome extension foundation with manifest.json and basic project structure.

### Tech Stack Context

[Source: architecture.md#tech-stack]

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18.2+ for UI component architecture
- **Build Tool**: Vite 4.0+ optimized for Chrome extension development
- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript 5.0+ for type-safe development
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS 3.3+ for styling system

### Project Structure Alignment

[Source: architecture.md#unified-project-structure]
Key files to create/modify:

```
wysiwyg-md-editor/
├── src/pages/
│   └── NewTab.tsx                     # Main new tab page component
├── public/
│   └── newtab.html                    # New tab override entry point
├── src/components/layout/
│   ├── AppLayout.tsx                  # Main application layout
│   └── Header.tsx                     # App header component
└── src/extension/
    └── manifest.json                  # Update with newtab override
```

### Chrome Extension Integration

[Source: architecture.md#high-level-architecture]

- **New Tab Override**: Uses chrome_url_overrides.newtab to replace default page
- **React Application Mount**: Chrome new tab loads React application instantly
- **Performance Target**: Sub-500ms load time critical for user experience
- **Navigation Integration**: Must work seamlessly with browser navigation

### React Application Architecture

[Source: architecture.md#frontend-architecture]

- **Component Organization**: Pages in src/pages/, layouts in src/components/layout/
- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer for application state
- **Error Boundaries**: Global error boundary for Chrome extension context
- **Loading States**: Proper loading states during app initialization

### Performance Optimization Requirements

[Source: architecture.md#security-and-performance]

- **Bundle Size Target**: <2MB total extension size
- **Loading Strategy**: Lazy loading for non-critical components, code splitting by route
- **Critical Path**: Inline critical CSS, optimize first paint
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of React components and event listeners

### Testing

#### Test file location:

Tests should be created in `tests/pages/NewTab.test.tsx` and `tests/extension/newtab-override.test.ts`

#### Test standards:

[Source: architecture.md#testing-strategy]

- **Unit Testing**: React component testing with React Testing Library
- **Integration Testing**: Chrome extension new tab override functionality
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright tests for full new tab workflow
- **Performance Testing**: Load time and bundle size validation

#### Testing requirements for this story:

- Unit tests for NewTab component and app initialization
- Integration tests for manifest new tab override configuration
- E2E tests for new tab triggers (Ctrl+T, click +, etc.)
- Performance tests to validate 500ms load target
- Browser navigation integration tests (back/forward)
